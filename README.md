This is just a small project to try out some PWA and Firebase. :)

## Configuration

1 - Go to firebase console [https://console.firebase.google.com/] and create your project.

2 - Rename ".example.env" to ".env" and replace the firebase url with your own


3 - Install firebase locally:
```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

4 - ng add @angular/fire

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
